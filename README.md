# Pong Game

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/tR0JXSS.jpg)

A basic pong game using HTML5 Canvas and ECMA 2016.
This is also my first time using WebPack instead of Gulp.
Still in the process of adding an AI player and a start page.

## Difficulties:
Being one of my actual javascript based projects, it was difficult to understand at first.

##Key points:
I changed the ball into a Simpsons donut for a personal touch.

## Keys

####Player 1:
* a: up
* z: down
* q: fire a new ball

##### Player 2:
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down
* /: fire a new ball
